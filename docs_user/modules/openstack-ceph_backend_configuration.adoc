= Configuring a Ceph backend

If the original deployment uses a Ceph storage backend for any service
(e.g. Glance, Cinder, Nova, Manila), the same backend must be used in the
adopted deployment and CRs must be configured accordingly.

== Prerequisites

* The `OpenStackControlPlane` CR must already exist.

== Variables

Define the shell variables used in the steps below. The values are
just illustrative, use values that are correct for your environment:

[subs=+quotes]
----
ifeval::["{build}" != "downstream"]
CEPH_SSH="ssh -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@192.168.122.100"
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
CEPH_SSH="ssh -i *<path to SSH key>* root@*<node IP>*"
endif::[]
CEPH_KEY=$($CEPH_SSH "cat /etc/ceph/ceph.client.openstack.keyring | base64 -w 0")
CEPH_CONF=$($CEPH_SSH "cat /etc/ceph/ceph.conf | base64 -w 0")
----

== Modify capabilities of the "openstack" user to accommodate Manila

On TripleO environments, the CephFS driver in Manila is configured to use
its own keypair. For convenience, modify the `openstack` user so that you
can use it across all OpenStack services.

Using the same user across the services serves two purposes:

* The capabilities of the user required to interact with the Manila service
became far simpler and hence, more became more secure with RHOSP 18.
* It is simpler to create a common ceph secret (keyring and ceph config
file) and propagate the secret to all services that need it.

TIP: To run `ceph` commands, you must use SSH to connect to a Ceph
storage node and run `sudo cephadm shell`. This brings up a ceph orchestrator
container that allows you to run administrative commands against the ceph
cluster. If Director deployed the ceph cluster, you may launch the cephadm
shell from an OpenStack controller node.

----
ceph auth caps client.openstack \
  mgr 'allow *' \
  mon 'allow r, profile rbd' \
  osd 'profile rbd pool=vms, profile rbd pool=volumes, profile rbd pool=images, allow rw pool manila_data'
----

== Ceph backend configuration

Create the `ceph-conf-files` secret, containing Ceph configuration:

----
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ceph.client.openstack.keyring: $CEPH_KEY
  ceph.conf: $CEPH_CONF
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-conf-files
  namespace: openstack
type: Opaque
EOF
----

The content of the file should look something like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-conf-files
  namespace: openstack
stringData:
  ceph.client.openstack.keyring: |
    [client.openstack]
        key = <secret key>
        caps mgr = "allow *"
        caps mon = "allow r, profile rbd"
        caps osd = "pool=vms, profile rbd pool=volumes, profile rbd pool=images, allow rw pool manila_data'
  ceph.conf: |
    [global]
    fsid = 7a1719e8-9c59-49e2-ae2b-d7eb08c695d4
    mon_host = 10.1.1.2,10.1.1.3,10.1.1.4
----

Configure `extraMounts` within the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR:

[source,yaml]
----
oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack --type=merge --patch '
spec:
  extraMounts:
    - name: v1
      region: r1
      extraVol:
        - propagation:
          - CinderVolume
          - CinderBackup
          - GlanceAPI
          - ManilaShare
          extraVolType: Ceph
          volumes:
          - name: ceph
            projected:
              sources:
              - secret:
                  name: ceph-conf-files
          mounts:
          - name: ceph
            mountPath: "/etc/ceph"
            readOnly: true
'

== Getting Ceph FSID

Configuring some OpenStack services to use Ceph backend may require
the FSID value. You can fetch the value from the config like so:

[source,bash]
----
CEPH_FSID=$(oc get secret ceph-conf-files -o json | jq -r '.data."ceph.conf"' | base64 -d | grep fsid | sed -e 's/fsid = //')

== Creating a Ceph NFS cluster

If you use the Ceph via NFS backend with OpenStack Manila, prior to adoption,
you must create a new clustered NFS service on the Ceph cluster. This service
will replace the standalone, pacemaker-controlled `ceph-nfs` service that was
used on {osp_prev_long} {osp_prev_ver}.


=== Ceph node preparation

* You must identify the ceph nodes to deploy the new clustered NFS service.
* This service must be deployed on the `StorageNFS` isolated network so that
it is easier for clients to mount their existing shares through the new NFS
export locations.
* You must propagate the `StorageNFS` network to the target nodes
where the `ceph-nfs` service will be deployed. See link:https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/tripleo-docs/wallaby/features/network_isolation.html#deploying-the-overcloud-with-network-isolation[Deploying
an Overcloud with Network Isolation with TripleO] and link:https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/tripleo-docs/wallaby/post_deployment/updating_network_configuration_post_deployment.html[Applying
network configuration changes after deployment] for the background to these
tasks. The following steps will be relevant if the Ceph Storage nodes were
deployed via Director.
** Identify the node definition file used in the environment. This is
the input file associated with the `openstack overcloud node provision`
command. For example, this file may be called `overcloud-baremetal-deploy.yaml`
** Edit the networks associated with the `CephStorage` nodes to include the
`StorageNFS` network:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: CephStorage
  count: 3
  hostname_format: cephstorage-%index%
  instances:
  - hostname: cephstorage-0
    name: ceph-0
  - hostname: cephstorage-1
    name: ceph-1
  - hostname: cephstorage-2
    name: ceph-2
  defaults:
    profile: ceph-storage
    network_config:
      template: /home/stack/network/nic-configs/ceph-storage.j2
      network_config_update: true
    networks:
    - network: ctlplane
      vif: true
    - network: storage
    - network: storage_mgmt
    - network: storage_nfs
----
** Edit the network configuration template file for the `CephStorage` nodes
to include an interface connecting to the `StorageNFS` network. In the
example above, the path to the network configuration template file is
`/home/stack/network/nic-configs/ceph-storage.j2`. This file is modified
to include the following NIC template:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- type: vlan
  device: nic2
  vlan_id: {{ storage_nfs_vlan_id }}
  addresses:
  - ip_netmask: {{ storage_nfs_ip }}/{{ storage_nfs_cidr }}
  routes: {{ storage_nfs_host_routes }}
----
** Re-run the `openstack overcloud node provision` command to update the
`CephStorage` nodes.
+
[source,bash]
----
openstack overcloud node provision \
    --stack overcloud   \
    --network-config -y  \
    -o overcloud-baremetal-deployed-storage_nfs.yaml \
    --concurrency 2 \
    /home/stack/network/baremetal_deployment.yaml
----
** When the update is complete, ensure that the `CephStorage` nodes have a
new interface created and tagged with the appropriate VLAN associated with
`StorageNFS`.

=== Ceph NFS cluster creation

* Identify an IP address from the `StorageNFS` network to use as the Virtual IP
address for the Ceph NFS service. This IP address must be provided in place of
the `{{ VIP }}` in the example below. You can query used IP addresses with:

[source,bash]
----
openstack port list -c "Fixed IP Addresses" --network storage_nfs
----

* Pick an appropriate size for the NFS cluster. The NFS service provides
active/active high availability when the cluster size is more than
one node. It is recommended that the ``{{ cluster_size }}`` is at least one
less than the number of hosts identified. This solution has been well tested
with a 3-node NFS cluster.
* The `ingress-mode` argument must be set to ``haproxy-protocol``. No other
ingress-mode will be supported. This ingress mode will allow enforcing client
restrictions through OpenStack Manila.
* For more information on deploying the clustered Ceph NFS service, see the
link:https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephadm/services/nfs/[ceph orchestrator
documentation]
* The following commands are run inside a `cephadm shell` to create a clustered
Ceph NFS service.

[source,bash]
----

# wait for shell to come up, then execute:
ceph orch host ls

# Identify the hosts that can host the NFS service.
# Repeat the following command to label each host identified:
ceph orch host label add <HOST> nfs

# Set the appropriate {{ cluster_size }} and {{ VIP }}:
ceph nfs cluster create cephfs \
    "{{ cluster_size }} label:nfs" \
    --ingress \
    --virtual-ip={{ VIP }}
    --ingress-mode=haproxy-protocol
}}

# Check the status of the nfs cluster with these commands
ceph nfs cluster ls
ceph nfs cluster info cephfs
