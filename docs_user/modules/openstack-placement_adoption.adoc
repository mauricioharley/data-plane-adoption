= Adopting the Placement service

== Prerequisites

* Previous Adoption steps completed. Notably,
 ** the xref:migrating-databases-to-mariadb-instances_{context}[Migrating databases to MariaDB instances]
must already be imported into the podified MariaDB.
 ** the xref:adopting-the-identity-service_{context}[Adopting the Identity service] needs to be imported.
 ** the Memcached operator needs to be deployed (nothing to import for it from
the source environment).

== Variables

There are no shell variables necessary currently.

== Procedure - Placement adoption

* Patch OpenStackControlPlane to deploy Placement:

----
oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack --type=merge --patch '
spec:
  placement:
    enabled: true
    apiOverride:
      route: {}
    template:
      databaseInstance: openstack
      databaseAccount: placement
      secret: osp-secret
      override:
        service:
          internal:
            metadata:
              annotations:
                metallb.universe.tf/address-pool: internalapi
                metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip: internalapi
                metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs: 172.17.0.80
            spec:
              type: LoadBalancer
'

== Post-checks

* See that Placement endpoints are defined and pointing to the
podified FQDNs and that Placement API responds.
