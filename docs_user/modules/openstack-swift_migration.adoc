//:context: migrate-object-storage-service

[id="migrating-the-object-storage-service_{context}"]

This section only applies if you are using OpenStack Swift as Object Storage
service. If you are using the Object Storage *API* of Ceph RGW this section can
be skipped.

Data migration to the new deployment might be a long running process that runs
mostly in the background. The Swift replicators will take care of moving data
from old to new nodes, but depending on the amount of used storage this might
take a very long time. You can still use the old nodes as long as they are
running and continue with adopting other services in the meantime, reducing the
amount of downtime. Please note that performance might be decreased to the
amount of replication traffic in the network.

Migration of the data happens replica by replica. Assuming you start with 3
replicas, only 1 one them is being moved at any time, ensuring the remaining 2
replicas are still available and the Swift service is usable during the
migration.

= Overview

To ensure availability during migration the following steps will be done:

. Add new nodes to the Swift rings
. Set weights of existing nodes to 0
. Rebalance rings, moving one replica
. Copy rings to old nodes and restart services
. Check replication status and repeat previous two steps until old nodes are
drained
. Finally remove the old nodes from the rings

= Prerequisites

* Previous Object Storage Service adoption steps successfully completed.

== Variables

No new environmental variables need to be defined, though you use the
`CONTROLLER1_SSH` alias that was defined in a previous step.

= Preliminary steps

== DNS

All existing nodes must be able to resolve host names of the OpenShift pods, for example by using the
external IP of the DNSMasq service as name server in `/etc/resolv.conf`:

----
oc get service dnsmasq-dns -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}" | CONTROLLER1_SSH tee /etc/resolv.conf
----


== swift-dispersion

To track the current status of the replication a tool called `swift-dispersion`
is used. It consists of two parts, a population tool to be run before changing
the Swift rings and a report tool to run afterwards to gather the current
status. Run the `swift-dispersion-populate` like this:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c 'swift-ring-tool get && swift-dispersion-populate'
----

The command might need a few minutes until completed. It creates 0-byte objects
distributed across the Swift deployment, and its counter-part
`swift-dispersion-report` can be used afterwards to show the current
replication status.

The output of the `swift-dispersion-report` command should look like this:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c 'swift-ring-tool get && swift-dispersion-report'
----

[source]
----
Queried 1024 containers for dispersion reporting, 5s, 0 retries
100.00% of container copies found (3072 of 3072)
Sample represents 100.00% of the container partition space
Queried 1024 objects for dispersion reporting, 4s, 0 retries
There were 1024 partitions missing 0 copies.
100.00% of object copies found (3072 of 3072)
Sample represents 100.00% of the object partition space
----

= Migrate data

== Add new nodes
The easiest way is to simply scale up the SwiftStorage resource from 0 to 3. In
that case 3 storage instances using PVCs are created, running on the
OpenShift cluster.

// TODO add paragraph / link on EDPM node usage for Swift

----
oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack --type=merge -p='{"spec":{"swift":{"template":{"swiftStorage":{"replicas": 3}}}}}'
----

Wait until all three pods are running:

----
oc wait pods --for condition=Ready -l component=swift-storage
----

== Start migration

You can start to drain the existing nodes now. Get the storage management IP
addresses of the nodes to drain from the current rings:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c 'swift-ring-tool get && swift-ring-builder object.builder' | tail -n +7 | awk '{print $4}' | sort -u
----

The output will look similar to this:

[source]
----
172.20.0.100:6200
swift-storage-0.swift-storage.openstack.svc:6200
swift-storage-1.swift-storage.openstack.svc:6200
swift-storage-2.swift-storage.openstack.svc:6200
----

In this case the old node 172.20.0.100 will be drained. Your nodes might be
different, and depending on the deployment there are likely more nodes to be
included in the following commands.

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c '
swift-ring-tool get
swift-ring-tool drain 172.20.0.100
swift-ring-tool rebalance
swift-ring-tool push'
----

The updated rings need to be copied and applied to the old nodes now. Run the
ssh commands for your existing nodes storing Swift data.

----
oc extract --confirm cm/swift-ring-files
CONTROLLER1_SSH "tar -C /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/swift/etc/swift/ -xzf -" < swiftrings.tar.gz
CONTROLLER1_SSH "systemctl restart tripleo_swift_*"
----

You can now track the replication progress by using the
`swift-dispersion-report` tool:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c "swift-ring-tool get && swift-dispersion-report"
----

The output will show less than 100% of copies found, repeat the above command
until both the container and all container and object copies are found:

[source]
----
Queried 1024 containers for dispersion reporting, 6s, 0 retries
There were 5 partitions missing 1 copy.
99.84% of container copies found (3067 of 3072)
Sample represents 100.00% of the container partition space
Queried 1024 objects for dispersion reporting, 7s, 0 retries
There were 739 partitions missing 1 copy.
There were 285 partitions missing 0 copies.
75.94% of object copies found (2333 of 3072)
Sample represents 100.00% of the object partition space
----

== Move all replicas
Once all container and object copies are found it's time to move the next
replica to the new nodes. To do so, rebalance and distribute the rings again:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c '
swift-ring-tool get
swift-ring-tool rebalance
swift-ring-tool push'

oc extract --confirm cm/swift-ring-files
CONTROLLER1_SSH "tar -C /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/swift/etc/swift/ -xzf -" < swiftrings.tar.gz
CONTROLLER1_SSH "systemctl restart tripleo_swift_*"
----

Monitor the `swift-dispersion-report` output again, wait until all copies are
found again and repeat above step until all your replicas are moved to the new
nodes.

= Final checks

Even if all replicas are already on the the new nodes and the
`swift-dispersion-report` command reports 100% of the copies found, there might
still be data on old nodes. This data is removed by the replicators, but it
might take some more time.

You can check the disk usage of all disks in the cluster using the following
command:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c 'swift-ring-tool get && swift-recon -d'
----

Eventually your existing nodes will be drained and there should
be no more `\*.db` or `*.data` files in the directory `/srv/node` on these
nodes:

----
CONTROLLER1_SSH "find /srv/node/ -type f -name '*.db' -o -name '*.data' | wc -l"
----

= Remove old nodes

Once nodes are drained they should be removed from the rings using the
following commands:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c '
swift-ring-tool get
swift-ring-tool remove 172.20.0.100
swift-ring-tool rebalance
swift-ring-tool push'
----

= Troubleshooting

The following commands might be helpful to debug if the replication is not
working and the `swift-dispersion-report` is not get back to 100% availability.

----
CONTROLLER1_SSH tail /var/log/containers/swift/swift.log | grep object-server
----

This should show progress by the replicators, for example like this:
[source]

----

You can also check the ring consistency and replicator status using the
following command:

----
oc debug --keep-labels=true job/swift-ring-rebalance -- /bin/sh -c 'swift-ring-tool get && swift-recon -r --md5'
----

Note that the output might show a md5 mismatch until approx. 2 minutes after
pushing new rings. Eventually it looks similar to this:
